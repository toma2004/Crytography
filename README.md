# Crytography
Solve cryptography problems using standard methods. All codes are written in C99 standard

Project Overview:
The goal is to provide a starting point with working code to nowadays cryptography problems for encrypting/decrypting and generating large provable prime numbers.

Problem 1 is a warm-up with bit manipulation

Problem 2 utilizes visual cryptography for encrypting/decrypting. For more info, please see here: http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/~dstinson/visual.html

Problem 3 performs some basic cryptanalysis on known methods to try to break some weak encrypting techniques that we should avoid to use with nowadays standard

Problem 4 implements DES for encrypting/decrypting a block of 64 bits

Problem 5 implments AES for encrypting/decrypting a block of 128 bits

Problem 6 implements methods to generate provable large primes

Problem 7 implements 5 different tests for randomness in bit generation
